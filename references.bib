  abstract = {This article adopts a 2-UPSþUP (U, P, and S are universal joint, the prismatic joint, and sphere joint, respectively) parallel mechanism as the leg mechanism of the quadruped walking robot based on the bionic concept and the motion capacity of the leg mechanism. The article investigates the kinematics (including the leg mechanism and the whole mechanism), gait planning, control, and experiment in detail. The following tasks are conducted: (1) designing the whole mechanism and developing the kinematics equations for both the leg mechanism and the whole mechanism; (2) planning the trotting gait and designing the foot trajectory based on the robot characteristics and conducting the kinematics analysis; (3) building the control system of the robot using self-developed controllers and drivers and studying the compound position control strategy; and (4) conducting the experiments for validating the controller, the compound position control strategy, the trotting pace, carrying capacity, and human-carrying walking. The results confirm that the proposed human-carrying walking robot has good performance and it is also verified that the controller and the compound position control strategy are suitable.},

@article{Cheng2011,
abstract = {Emerging wireless remote sensing technologies offer significant potential to advance the management of construction processes by providing real-time access to the locations of workers, materials, and equipment. Unfortunately, little is known regarding the accuracy, reliability, and practical benefits of an emerging technology, effectively impeding widespread adoption. This paper evaluates a commercially-available Ultra Wideband (UWB) system for real-time, mobile resource location tracking in harsh construction environments. A focus of this paper is to measure the performance of the UWB technology for tracking mobile resources in real-world construction settings. To assess tracking accuracy, location error rates for select UWB track signals are obtained by automatically tracking a single entity using a Robotic Total Station (RTS) for ground truth. Furthermore, to demonstrate the benefits of UWB technology, the paper provides case studies of resource tracking for analysis of worksite operations. The work demonstrates the applicability of UWB for the design of construction management support tools.},
