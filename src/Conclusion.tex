\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this document, we have described the current scientific work completed in the realization of this thesis.
In total, I have published one conference paper and one journal paper and submitted another conference paper as the first author.
Meanwhile, I have taken part in an additional four papers as a co-author.
This scientific production will represent the majority of the content of my article insertion thesis.

For the last chapter of the thesis, I have identified three last experiments which would be relatively simple to complete considering the amount of work already completed.
Providing these results are conclusive, they will be added in the final chapter of my thesis and potentially be used to write a final conference paper.
The initial thesis submission is scheduled for March 2024, leading to the defense in August 2024 according to Universit√© Laval standards.
